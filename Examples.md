## Examples of implementations after tooladjustments

Because from earlier test, Geonovum concluded tools were not compliant with the requirements, at the beginning of the year 2023, an open tender was set up to adjust the tooling.
This resulted in 3 demo services that each show how you can be compliant with the requirements for OGC, INSPIRE and Dutch ADR.
All demo services used the same selection of the Dutch INSPIRE Addresses in a GML file as input.

### Pygeoapi versus requirements

The following findings show how Pygeoapi complies to the requirements.

***RQ 1:OGC API Features Core***  
The OGC CITE validator gave no error.

***RQ 4:predefined download***

***RQ 5:GeoJSON***
Items can be retrieved in Geo+Json by:  
https://apitestbed.geonovum.nl/adr_pygeoapi/v1/collections/AddressesNL/items?f=json

***RQ 6:bulk download***

        },

***RQ 7:CRS ETRS89 and WGS84***
For RD: https://apitestbed.geonovum.nl/adr_pygeoapi/v1/collections/AddressesNL/items/1?f=json&crs=http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/28992
For WGS84: https://apitestbed.geonovum.nl/adr_pygeoapi/v1/collections/AddressesNL/items/1?f=json&crs=http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84
for ETRS89:  https://apitestbed.geonovum.nl/adr_pygeoapi/v1/collections/AddressesNL/items/1?f=json&crs=http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4258

The storagecrs can be found at the end of:
https://apitestbed.geonovum.nl/adr_pygeoapi/v1/collections/AddressesNL?f=json 

With the following command line request, one can see the Content-CRS value in the header :
curl -i https://apitestbed.geonovum.nl/adr_pygeoapi/v1/collections/AddressesNL/items/1?f=json

An adjustment has been made tot the bbox filter. It now also supports the bbox-crs parameter.
Only 2 addresses are available in the below defined bbox.
https://apitestbed.geonovum.nl/adr_pygeoapi/v1/collections/AddressesNL/items?f=json&bbox-crs=http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/28992&bbox=252200,593000,252710,594000

***RQ 8:GML*** 
As input, a simple features GML file was used as produced by Wetransform from the complex feature GML with the transformation software Hale.
As output, there is a link to the original complex feature GML-file:
https://service.pdok.nl/kadaster/ad/atom/downloads/addresses.gml.gz 
Pygeoapi does not support GML-output at item-level, but this is not a requirement.

***RQ 9:Dutch API design rules***  
It complies with all the rules, except for rule https://publicatie.centrumvoorstandaarden.nl/api/adr/#api-48.
This rule in the Dutch ADR prescribes that none of the API endpoints should have a trailing slash. On the other end, the OGC specification states that the landing page (i.e. "Home") should have a trailing slash. So the rules contradict.
It is expected that in future, this ADR-rule will make an exception for the landingpage.

***RQ 10:describing encoding***  
There is a link to https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/2017.2/tree/master/GeoJSON/ads at [colection/AddressesNL level](https://apitestbed.geonovum.nl/adr_pygeoapi/v1/collections/AddressesNL?f=json )
{
            "type": "text/html",

            "href": "https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/2017.2/tree/master/GeoJSON/ads",
            "hreflang": "en"
        },

***RQ 11:filtering***  
For the use of filters, the bbox and items options were already available. Next to that, one can filter on the attributes which can be retrieved from:
https://apitestbed.geonovum.nl/adr_pygeoapi/v1/collections/AddressesNL/queryables.
The specification for filtering [[PUB-6]] does not yet have the status "approved" and has not yet been considered.

***RQ 12:metadata links***  
1. Metadata link of the dataset can be found at [/collections/AddressesNL level](https://apitestbed.geonovum.nl/adr_pygeoapi/v1/collections/AddressesNL?f=json):
        {
            "type": "text/html",
            "rel": "describedby",
            "title": "Metadata as HTML",
            "href": "https://www.nationaalgeoregister.nl/geonetwork/srv/dut/catalog.search#/metadata/a5f961e9-ebdd-41e2-b8e8-ab33ed340a83",
            "hreflang": "nl"
        } 
2. Metadata of the service can be obtained from: https://apitestbed.geonovum.nl/adr_pygeoapi/v1/openapi?f=json and https://apitestbed.geonovum.nl/adr_pygeoapi/v1/collections/AddressesNL.

This rule in the Dutch ADR prescribes that none of the API endpoints should have a trailing slash. On the other end, the OGC specification states that the landing page (i.e. "Home") should have a trailing slash. So the rules contradict.

More information about the Deegree adjustments to the standards can be found at https://www.geonovum.nl/uploads/documents/deegree%20OGC%20API%20Features.pdf

### General findings

1. There has been discussions whether the predefined downloadlinks (RQ4) should be at collections or collections/collection level? See also: https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/gp-ogc-api-features/issues/91. 
During the project we had the opinion that both should be possible, but afterwards we found out that it should be at collections level.
2. The protocol element in the metadata is based on a code list. A new protocol needs to be added to this list of [protocol values]https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/ProtocolValue:1). As long as it is not there, the Dutch profile for metadata can be used with the value: "OGC:API features" https://geonovum.github.io/Metadata-ISO19119/#codelist-protocol.
3. Another blocking issue before implementation of the OAPIF for INSPIRE is that descriptions of encodings other than GML are not yet available for most INSPIRE themes.
4. Complex GML as input and output are difficult as long as tooling (server and client) expects simple encodings.
5. One could discuss if it is useful to publish complex GML as output, because it is not in line with the aim of OGI API Features: easy to use for developers.
6. Complex GML as input needs a flattening of the data. This is needed for the software that publishes the features. It can only work with simple features, with one value per attribute and without relations to other objects. This is often not the case with the more complex INSPIRE models.
