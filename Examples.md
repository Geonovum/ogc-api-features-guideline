## Examples of implementations

From earlier tests Geonovum concluded tools were not compliant with the requirements for OAS, OGC, INSPIRE and Dutch ADR. For that reason Geonovum set up an open tender at the beginning of the year 2023, with the goal of improving the compliance of OGC API tooling.
This resulted in demo services that each show how you can be compliant with the requirements.
These demo services used the same selection of the Dutch INSPIRE Addresses in a simplified GML file, constructed by Wetransform as input.
Next to these demoservices, an other service that is in production is reviewed in regards to the standards.

Per tool, findings are elaborated in the next chapters when relevant.

### Pygeoapi versus requirements

The following findings show how Pygeoapi complies to the requirements with an OAPIF service for INSPIRE harmonized Dutch Addresses.

#### OAS

The OAS document is available: https://apitestbed.geonovum.nl/adr_pygeoapi/v1/openapi

#### OGC 

The OGC CITE validator gave no error at the [landing page](https://apitestbed.geonovum.nl/adr_pygeoapi/v1).

***Filtering***  

For the use of filters, the bbox and items options were already available. In addition, one can filter on the attributes which can be retrieved from
https://apitestbed.geonovum.nl/adr_pygeoapi/v1/collections/AddressesNL/queryables.
https://apitestbed.geonovum.nl/adr_pygeoapi/v1/collections/AddressesNL/items?filter=locator_designator_postalDeliveryIdentifier=%279901AA%27 does unfortunately not work.

The OGC API specification for filtering [[PUB-6]] did not not yet have the status "approved" at the time of this service publication and has therefor not been considered further.

***CRS***

The crs identifier list and storage-crs can be found at the end of:
https://apitestbed.geonovum.nl/adr_pygeoapi/v1/collections/AddressesNL?f=json 

With the following command line request, one can see the Content-CRS value in the header:

`curl -i https://apitestbed.geonovum.nl/adr_pygeoapi/v1/collections/AddressesNL/items/1?f=json`

An adjustment has been made to the bbox filter. It now also supports the bbox-crs parameter.
Only 2 addresses are available in the below defined bbox.
https://apitestbed.geonovum.nl/adr_pygeoapi/v1/collections/AddressesNL/items?f=json&bbox-crs=http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/28992&bbox=252200,593000,252710,594000


#### Dutch API design rules  

It complies with all the rules, except for rule https://gitdocumentatie.logius.nl/publicatie/api/adr/#/core/no-trailing-slash.
This rule in the Dutch ADR prescribes that none of the API endpoints should have a trailing slash. However, the OGC specification states that the landing page (i.e. "Home") should have a trailing slash. So the rules contradict.
It is expected that in future, this ADR-rule will make an exception for the landing page.

#### INSPIRE

### Geoserver versus requirements

The following findings show how Geoserver complies to the requirements with an OAPIF service for INSPIRE harmonized Dutch Addresses.

#### OAS

The OAS document is available: https://geonovum.geosolutionsgroup.com/geoserver/inspire/ogc/features/v1/openapi

#### OGC  

The OGC CITE validator gave no error at the landing page https://geonovum.geosolutionsgroup.com/geoserver/inspire/ogc/features/v1.

***Filtering***  

For the use of filters, the bbox and items options were already available. In addition, one can filter on the attributes which can be retrieved from:
https://geonovum.geosolutionsgroup.com/geoserver/inspire/ogc/features/v1/collections/SimpleAddress?queryables.
https://geonovum.geosolutionsgroup.com/geoserver/inspire/ogc/features/v1/collections/SimpleAddress/items?filter=locator_designator_postalDeliveryIdentifier=%279901AA%27 only gives the addresses with postal code '9901AA'. 

The OGC API specification for filtering [[PUB-6]] did not not yet have the status "approved" at the time of this service publication and has therefor not been considered further.

***CRS***

The crs identifier list and the storage-crs can be found at:
https://geonovum.geosolutionsgroup.com/geoserver/inspire/ogc/features/v1/collections/SimpleAddress?f=json

It is expected that in future, this ADR-rule will make an exception for the landing page.

At first the collection was named "AddressesNL". At a later stage, it has been changed to "SimpleAddress". This is not according to the [rule for naming collections](https://gitdocumentatie.logius.nl/publicatie/api/adr/#/core/naming-collections) because it is not a plural.

### Gokoala BRT versus requirements

The following findings show how Gokoala with the OAF service for the BRT dataset complies to the requirements.

#### OAS 

The OAS document is available at: https://api.pdok.nl/brt/top10nl/ogc/v1/api

#### OGC

The OGC CITE validator gave no error at the landing page: https://api.pdok.nl/brt/top10nl/ogc/v1.

***Filtering***  

For the use of filters, the bbox and items options were available.
https://api.pdok.nl/brt/top10nl/ogc/v1/collections/gebouw_punt/queryables is not supported.

The OGC API specification for filtering [[PUB-6]] did not not yet have the status "approved" at the time of this service publication and has therefor not been considered further.

***CRS***

The crs identifier list and storage-crs can be found at:
https://api.pdok.nl/brt/top10nl/ogc/v1/collections?f=json where it is repeated for each collection.
and at each collection level, for instance: https://api.pdok.nl/brt/top10nl/ogc/v1/collections/gebouw_punt?f=json

With the following command line request, one can see the Content-CRS value in the header :

`curl -i https://api.pdok.nl/brt/top10nl/ogc/v1/collections/gebouw_punt/items?limit=1`

It supports the bbox filter and the bbox-crs parameter.
Only 5 points are available in the below defined bbox:
https://api.pdok.nl/brt/top10nl/ogc/v1/collections/gebouw_punt/items?bbox-crs=http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/28992&bbox=252000,593000,253000,594000


#### Dutch API design rules  

It complies with all the rules, except for rule https://gitdocumentatie.logius.nl/publicatie/api/adr/#/core/no-trailing-slash and https://gitdocumentatie.logius.nl/publicatie/api/adr/#/core/naming-collections.
The rule "no-trailing-slash" in the Dutch ADR prescribes that none of the API endpoints should have a trailing slash. However, the OGC specification states that the landing page (i.e. "Home") should have a trailing slash. So the rules contradict.
It is expected that in future, this ADR-rule will make an exception for the landing page.  

The rule [naming-collection](https://gitdocumentatie.logius.nl/publicatie/api/adr/#/core/naming-collections) demands that the path segment describing the name of the collection resource MUST be written in the plural form.
In the original dataset of the BRT, the layers were already described in a singular form. It is understandable that they want it to be the same in the API as in the original dataset. 

#### INSPIRE

The dataset BRT is an INSPIRE dataset AsIs and not an INSPIRE harmonized dataset, so not all the INSPIRE requirements are applicable.
Because the INSPIRE requirements can still be relevant they have been viewed, despite the fact that they are not all applicable.

***GML*** 

The input encoding options of Gokoala have not been investigated and are unknown for this dataset. The output of GML is not supported.

***Describing encoding***  

The describing of the encoding is not relevant, since it is no INSPIRE Harmonized dataset.

### General findings

1. There has been discussion whether the predefined download links should be at collections or collections/collection level. See also: https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/gp-ogc-api-features/issues/91.  
During the project of adjusting the tools we had the opinion that both should be possible.  
Afterwards, we found out that it should be at collections level since it is one of the [main principles](https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/gp-ogc-api-features/blob/master/spec/oapif-inspire-download.md#main-principles) in [PUB-2] to use one data set in one API.
Again, later we realized other kinds of OGC-API services like Tiles, can exist together on the same landing page. In that case, these links could also be provided on the landing page, also because not all OGC-API have collections. 
This was discussed at https://github.com/INSPIRE-MIF/gp-ogc-api-features/issues/93.
2. The protocol element in the metadata is based on a code list. A new protocol "OGC API-Features" was added to the list of [protocol values](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/metadata-codelist/ProtocolValue:1). But the given [id](http://www.opengis.net/def/docs/17-069r3) does not resolve.
As long as it does not resolve, the Dutch profile for metadata can be used with the value: "OGC:API features" https://geonovum.github.io/Metadata-ISO19119/#codelist-protocol.
The uri provided there does resolve: uri = http://www.opengis.net/def/interface/ogcapi-features
3. Another blocking issue before implementation of the OAPIF for INSPIRE is that descriptions of encodings other than GML are not yet available for most INSPIRE themes.
4. Complex GML as input and output are difficult as long as tooling (server and client) expects simple encodings.
5. One could discuss if it is useful to publish complex GML as output, because it is not in line with the aim of OGI API Features: easy to use for developers.
6. Complex GML as input needs a flattening of the data. This is needed for the software that publishes the features. It can only work with simple features, with one value per attribute and without relations to other objects.
This is often not the case with the more complex INSPIRE models.
