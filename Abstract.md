## Abstract

This document is a guideline for Dutch data providers who want to use OGC-API-Features for download services in a way that they comply with relevant standards.
The guideline has been written on the bases of the experiences gained from implementations of OGC-API-Features of INSPIRE datasets on test beds.
A second important bases is formed by the results of an open tender, held in the beginning of 2023. This tender aimed at adjusting tools for serving OGC-API-feature services to 3 standards: OGC, Dutch Application Design Rules and INSPIRE. Untill this tender, no tools were known that comply with all these standards. This guideline uses the demoservices from this open tender as an example how one can comply with the standards.
The aim of setting up these test beds and this guideline, has been to stimulate the Dutch data providers and hosting organizations to start publishing data as OGC API Features.
By doing this, a greater goal is reached: A better use of geospatial data.

A general recommendation to all parties involved is to adjust as much as possible to the existing requirements as stated in this document.
The most important recommendations for the hosting organizations is to stimulate data providers to start with OGC API features to increase the use of geospatial data according to standards.
Data providers are recommended to first orientate on the possible work of other data providers in this field. A roadmap is described with the steps needed to be taken by data providers.
