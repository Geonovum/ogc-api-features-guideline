## Examples of implementations after tooladjustments

Because from earlier test, Geonovum concluded tools were not compliant with the requirements, at the beginning of the year 2023, an open tender was set up to adjust the tooling.
This resulted in 3 demo services that each show how you can be compliant with the requirements for OGC, INSPIRE and Dutch ADR.
All demo services used the same selection of the Dutch INSPIRE Addresses in a GML file as input.
